# tracer

A minimalist mechanism to support adding a `traceid` and optional
`traceorigin` to context, as well as a `logr.Logger` also containing
these values.

The intended use case is where you need a context and logger with a
single value which is used for tracing purposes across multiple log
entries.

## Example

```go

// put and example here
